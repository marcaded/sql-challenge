# The only part of this that I struggled with was importing the data from csv
# I had to go to https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/ in order to use the copy function, since I got thrown errors when I did the normal manual exports from postgres, so I just hardcoded it even though I know that's not the correct way to do it.
